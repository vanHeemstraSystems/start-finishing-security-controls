# 100 - Introduction

This repository aims to help you in starting to finish the project of **security controls**.

![Air Bun](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/start-finishing-security-controls/assets/1499433/9fbc06f6-2515-4bf2-87f2-f9d2d077d740)

We are going to convert our *visionary* **ideas** into doable, *practical* **projects**.

## Challenges that keep you from doing your *best* work

| Challenges | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Competing Priorities** | as we are often pulled in different directions. |
| **Head Trash** | based on our own personal experiences, histories, and contexts. *Can't do* belief. |
| **No Realistic Plan** | needs to connect your vision, purpose, and big goals with day-to-day reality. Create plans that adapt and shift with reality. |
| **Too Few Resources** | when we don't notice the coffee shop, because we're looking for a Starbucks. President Theodore Roosevelt: "Do what you can, with what you've got, where you are." |
| **Poor Team Alignment** | when not focused on shared goals. Many of us have poor team alignment, not becasue the people on our team are in conflict, but because we're not communicating to our team what we want, need, and dream to be. |  

## What To Do?

| Using the Keys | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Align Competing Priorities**| - **Awareness**: Get clear about what matters to you, claim those priorities, and acknowledge that, try as you might, your reach will always exceed your grasp.<br> - **Discipline**: Keep first things first, even when it's easy to buckle.<br> - **Boundaries**: Establish structures and expectations that limit the influence of other people's priorities.|
| **Take Out Head Trash**| - **Awareness**: Be aware of when self-defeating beliefs and patterns are present, and discern what's real and what's simply absorbed bullshit. <br> - **Courage**: Have the backbone to challenge those beliefs, design experiments that mitigate the patterns, and accept the reality that your choices and responses have been cocreating whatever you're experiencing. <br> - **Discipline**: Stick with challenging beliefs, experimenting, and taking responsibility to change; courage without discipline leads to fits and starts rather than deep change.|
| **Remove the *No* from No Realistic Plan**| - **Awareness**: Be aware of where you'll fall down, where you'll shine, and where you're likely to bail on the project. <br> - **Discipline**: Stick with the plan when bright, shiny objects (BSOs) inevitably appear. I use "bright, shiny objects" as a shorthand for random and seemingly unlimited distractions we can spot and pounce on. <br> - **Intention**: ... |
| **Overcome Too Few Resources**| |
| **Turnaround Poor Team Alignment**| |

## How To Do It?

| Keys to overcoming the Air Bun by unlocking our *best* work. | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Intention** | Begin with the end in mind. Know your purpose and what is expected from you. |
| **Awareness** | is required to *know* what your best work is. |
| **Boundaries** | - Positive boundaries: create space for something. Add.<br> - Negative boundaries: create space from something. Remove. |
| **Courage** | when lacking is holding us back from doing our *best* work. |
| **Discipline** | Habits are discipline made automatic, but they're *made* automatic in the beginning and maintained via discipline. |
