# 4. Convert Your Idea Into A Project

## Choose Your Desired Level of Success

| Level of Success | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Small Success | Since tests are the easiest analogy, consider a **small** success as getting the minimum score needed to pass. |
| Moderate Success | A **moderate** success exceeds the minimum requirements for success. It is the highest level of success you can achieve with just **your own effort**, resources, and advantages. |
| Epic Success | An **epic** success greatly exceeds the minimum requirements for success. It requires you to build a **team** to help you get there. |
