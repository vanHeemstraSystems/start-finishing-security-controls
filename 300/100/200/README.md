# 200 - 2. Getting To Your Best Work

![Air Bun](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/start-finishing-security-controls/assets/1499433/9fbc06f6-2515-4bf2-87f2-f9d2d077d740)

We are going to convert our *visionary* **ideas** into doable, *practical* **projects**.

## Challenges that keep you from doing your *best* work

| Challenges | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Competing Priorities** | as we are often pulled in different directions. |
| **Head Trash** | based on our own personal experiences, histories, and contexts. *Can't do* belief. |
| **No Realistic Plan** | needs to connect your vision, purpose, and big goals with day-to-day reality. Create plans that adapt and shift with reality. |
| **Too Few Resources** | when we don't notice the coffee shop, because we're looking for a Starbucks. President Theodore Roosevelt: "Do what you can, with what you've got, where you are." |
| **Poor Team Alignment** | when not focused on shared goals. Many of us have poor team alignment, not becasue the people on our team are in conflict, but because we're not communicating to our team what we want, need, and dream to be. |  

## What To Do?

| Using the Keys | Keys contributions |
| --- | --- |
| **Align Competing Priorities**| - **Awareness**: Get clear about what matters to you, claim those priorities, and acknowledge that, try as you might, your reach will always exceed your grasp.<br> - **Boundaries**: Establish structures and expectations that limit the influence of other people's priorities. <br> - **Discipline**: Keep first things first, even when it's easy to buckle. |
| **Take Out Head Trash**| - **Awareness**: Be aware of when self-defeating beliefs and patterns are present, and discern what's real and what's simply absorbed bullshit. <br> - **Courage**: Have the backbone to challenge those beliefs, design experiments that mitigate the patterns, and accept the reality that your choices and responses have been cocreating whatever you're experiencing. <br> - **Discipline**: Stick with challenging beliefs, experimenting, and taking responsibility to change; courage without discipline leads to fits and starts rather than deep change.|
| **Remove the *No* from No Realistic Plan**| - **Intention**: Have a clear, unmixed, and as-specific-as-useful goal or destination. As the novelist and philosopher Lewis Caroll said, "If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there." We love to canvas all roads in lieu of walking down one. <br> - **Awareness**: Be aware of where you'll fall down, where you'll shine, and where you're likely to bail on the project. <br> - **Discipline**: Stick with the plan when bright, shiny objects (BSOs) inevitably appear. I use "bright, shiny objects" as a shorthand for random and seemingly unlimited distractions we can spot and pounce on. |
| **Overcome Too Few Resources**| - **Awareness**: Focus on who and what you *do* have more than what you don't have. Ask yourself, "How can I do this project without X?" and "What do I have that I'm not using to complete this project?" <br> - **Courage**: Be courageous enough to commit more fully to fewer projects. We often don't focus our resources on fewer goals and projects, because we're not sure that we'll be successful with those projects and thus want to hedge our bets. The result is that we invest too little into projects to make them successful and we're perennially scattered. How would you use your resources if you weren't hedging bets? <br> - **Discipline**: Efficiency requires discipline, and many of us aren't using what we have efficiently. How might you better use the resources you already have?|
| **Turnaround Poor Team Alignment**| - **Awareness**: Be aware of what you *really* want, need, and dream to do and be; and be able to communicate this clearly to others. Doing so is harder than most people think it is. <br> - **Boundaries**: Establish expectations, structures, and space to support your goals. Turn *someday*, *someone*, and *sometime* into a *specific* day, person, and time. <br> - **Courage**: Be brave enough to take up space, ask for help, and stop being the martyr so people will like you. |

## How To Do It?

| Keys to overcoming the Air Bun by unlocking our *best* work. | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Intention** | Begin with the end in mind. Know your purpose and what is expected from you. |
| **Awareness** | is required to *know* what your best work is. |
| **Boundaries** | - Positive boundaries: create space for something. Add.<br> - Negative boundaries: create space from something. Remove. |
| **Courage** | when lacking is holding us back from doing our *best* work. |
| **Discipline** | Habits are discipline made automatic, but they're *made* automatic in the beginning and maintained via discipline. |

## Takeaways

- The air bun is the gap between your big picture and your day-to-day reality.
- The air in the bun is actually filled by **five challenges** that keep you from doing your best work: competing priorities, head trash, no realistic plan, too few resources, and poor team alignment.
- The five challenges work in concert and can show up in different ways in different projects.
- There are **five keys** to doing your best work: intention, awareness, boundaries, courage, and discipline (mnemonic: IABCD).
- Some keys are more effective at overcoming specific challenges than others.
- The five keys are practices that can be cultivated, and we're often well cultivated in some but not others.
