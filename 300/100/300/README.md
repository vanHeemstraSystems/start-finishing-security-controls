## Prioritize Your Ideas

Avoid to use the flawed Effort vs. Impact Matrix as shown below:

![Security Controls Flawed Matrix](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/start-finishing-security-controls/assets/1499433/de8b582b-1c2c-482f-80a2-16488a767ce7)

Clayton Kjos explains the flaws of above matrix in [6 Major Flaws that make the Impact vs. Effort Matrix Obsolete](https://www.claytonkjos.com/blog/6-major-flaws-that-make-the-impact-vs-effort-matrix-obsolete).

Instead use his unflawed Effort vs. Impact matrix:

Clayton Kjos explains the unflawed above matrix in [Replace your 2x2 Impact vs. Effort Matrix!](https://www.claytonkjos.com/blog/t88kggug5sz3p5asz8nx9pymze1d7n).

Next, make a table to decide on what idea should take priority over what other ideas.

| Idea | Impact | Effort | Priorty Score (Impact / Effort) | Priority |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Access Control | 8 | 2 | 4 | 1 |
| Geofencing | 6 | 5 | 1.2 | 2 |
| XYZ | 4 | 7 | 0.57 | 3 |

Priority 1 is higher than priority 2.

## Takeaways

- The more something matters to you, the more you'll thrash, precisely because its success or failure is deeply important to you.
- Not doing your best work leads to creative constipation - at a certain point, you're too toxic to take new ideas in because you're not getting them out.
- We are but the latest in the line of gritty problem-solvers - we were made to slay dragons.
- The gift of failure is that it reveals what matters to you, shows you when you're out of alignment, and reveals a growth edge.
- Displacement - the fact that doing something now excludes doing anything else - can help you focus on what matters, but only after you accept the limitations of time and energy.
- You have to let go of projects and ideas that aren't allowing you to thrive so you can trade up to the projects that do.
- "Not now" isn't the same thing as "no".
