## Takeaways

- The more something matters to you, the more you'll thrash, precisely because its success or failure is deeply important to you.
- Not doing your best work leads to creative constipation - at a certain point, you're too toxic to take new ideas in because you're not getting them out.
- We are but the latest in the line of gritty problem-solvers - we were made to slay dragons.
- The gift of failure is that it reveals what matters to you, shows you when you're out of alignment, and reveals a growth edge.
- Displacement - the fact that doing something now excludes doing anything else - can help you focus on what matters, but only after you accept the limitations of time and energy.
- You have to let go of projects and ideas that aren't allowing you to thrive so you can trade up to the projects that do.
- "Not now" isn't the same thing as "no".
