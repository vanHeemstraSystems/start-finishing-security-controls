# 100 - "Someday" Can Be Today

## Takeaways

- We don't do ideas - we do projects.
- A project is anything that requires time, energy, and attention to complete.
- We thrive by doing our best work.
- Our lives and careers are marked by three- to five-year segments that can be thought of as projects.
- Projects are mirrors, because they reflect back to us what's really going on in our inner and outer worlds; projects are bridges, because it's only by doing them that we create the paths our souls want to walk.
- Every "and" aspect of ourselves requires upkeep in the form of projects.
- We can create new realities for ourselves, but only when we let go of the idea that we're uniquely defective.
